// Hash Map or Hash Table

/**
 * 1) A hash table, also known as hash map, is a ds that is used to store key-value pairs.
 * 2) Given a key, you can associate a value with that key for very fast lookup.
 * 3) Js's Object is a speacial implementation of the hash table ds.
 * 4) However, Object class adds its own keys. Keys that you i/p may conflict and overwrite the inherited default properties.
 * 5) Maps which were introduced in 2015 allow you to store key-value pairs.
 *
 * // Usage/ Applications
 * - Hash tables are typically implemented where constant time lookup and insertion are required.
 * - Database indexing.
 * - Caches

 * 5- Dequeue - Remove from front end.
 *
 * Queue usage:
 * a) Printers
 * b) CPU task scheduling.
 * c) Callback queue in js runtime.
 *
 * Circular Queue or Circular buffer or ring buffer (FIFO)
 * 1- The size of the queue is fixed and a single block of memory is used as if the first element is connected to the last element.
 * 2- A circular queue will reuse the emplty blocks created during the dequeue operation.
 * 3- When working with queues of fixed maximum size, a circular queue is a great implementation choice.
 *
 * Usage:-
 * Clock, Traffic light
